# Credit Card Fraud
## Introduction

In this project, I analyzed a credit card fraud dataset and developed a machine learning model to predict whether a transaction is fraudulent or not. Throughout the process, I experimented with various machine learning algorithms, as well as deep learning techniques, to determine the most effective model for the dataset. By evaluating multiple approaches and fine-tuning hyperparameters, I was able to identify the best-performing model, ensuring accurate and reliable predictions for detecting fraudulent transactions.
## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from kaggle data catalogue, accesible at the following link : (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)

## Data Processing

### Importing Data

I started by importing the dataset from the source. The data contains columns for several columns like V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, V6...Amount, Class

### Data Cleaning and Transformation 
I performed Data cleaning and transformation to ensure the consistency of the dataset. This includes removing empty columns to make sure I am not processing a zero data, ensuring there's no outlier, also ensuring there's no duplicate data and the data was ready for processing.

 ### Analysis and Insights 
I conducted an in-depth analysis of the dataset to extract meaningful insights that could aid decision -making. This includes showing plots to better understand such as:

- Count of Fraudulent and Legit transactions represented in the data
- Distribution of Class by amount 
- The best machine language model for the data as well as trying out the Tensor flow deep learning model.
 

## Summary and Findings
 The Project findings are documented in the `creditcardfraud.pdf` file. This include a narrative of the insights and findings on the dataset and how the machine language model which was the best suitable for the dataset

 ## Acknowledgments

  I will like to thank Kaggle for making this data available ,which serves as a foundation for this analysis
